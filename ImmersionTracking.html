          <h4 width=50%;>Wait what, Japanese?</h4>
          <p>Yep. I started learning around March~ish of sophomore year. I took it very casually in the beginning. Too casually. My attention span has been reduced to atoms over the years.<br>
            <br>I enjoyed being able to read, but what I could read (virtually nothing interesting) and the immense drag it felt to go through a textbook and workbook with my current attention span set me back far.<br> 
            <br>I did at only one grammar point per day along with the workbook exercises. Yeah, I made progress, albeit at a snail's pace.<br>
            <br>Thankfully I kept to the routine over the summer and did my Anki vocab learning/reviews. Now that I <i>have</i> accumulated some understanding of the grammar points (N4 LMAO), I've decided 
              to engage in Japanese content to keep me motivated whilst I study.<br>
                <br>I've kept to reading Kino's Journey starting around like two months ago? I didn't get much done because I got caught up in the ususal trap of finding the "perfect" immerison material. Wasted a bunch of time, least I know now.<br>
                <br>I've been using a pop-up dictionary to help me define new words, then using the same dictionary to add the word and sentence to Anki. Bonus points if they use Japanese in a way I've never seen before (probably grammar points)<br>
                <br>Other than that, its been mostly podcasts from native speakers on regular, daily life stuff.<br>
                <br>Light novels on the other hand...make me <i>VERY</i> uncomfortable. Very inconvient considering they bring the best of both worlds from speaking and reading.
                <br> Using text extractor, an auto line copier, and auto copy and paster, along with the actual voice lines, I can listen to a native say the line and use the pop-up dictionary if I don't understand anything. Very inconvient.<br>
                <br>I don't mind the plot all that much (still irks at me a bit though), its just the characters I have a problem with. I'll leave it at that.
            </p>
