          <h4 width=50%;>Wait what, Japanese?</h4>
          <p>Yep. I started learning around March~ish of sophomore year. I took it very casually in the beginning. Too casually. My attention span has been reduced to atoms over the years.<br>
            <br>I enjoyed being able to read, but what I could read (virtually nothing interesting) and the immense drag it felt to go through a textbook and workbook with my current attention span set me back far.<br> 
            <br>I did at only one grammar point per day along with the workbook exercises. Yeah, I made progress, albeit at a snail's pace.<br>
            <br>Thankfully I kept to the routine over the summer and did my Anki vocab learning/reviews. Now that I <i>have</i> accumulated some understanding of the grammar points (N4 LMAO), I've decided 
              to engage in Japanese content to keep me motivated whilst I study.<br>
                <br>I've kept to reading Kino's Journey starting around February? I didn't get much done because I got caught up in the ususal trap of finding the "perfect" immerison material. It was also my first light novel, reading purely Japanese for more than five minutes was torture for my brain.<br>
                <br>I've been using a pop-up dictionary to help me define new words, then using the same dictionary to add the word and sentence to Anki. Bonus points if they use Japanese in a way I've never seen before (probably grammar points)<br>
                <br>Other than that, its been mostly podcasts from native speakers on regular, daily life stuff.<br>
