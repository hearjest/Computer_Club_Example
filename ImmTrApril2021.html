                    <p width=95% text-align=left>Comments: No entry this week. So busy. So stressed. Projects, ap cs exam, sat. Only today, on Sunday, do I feel like I've accepted the inevitable
                        It feels kind of peaceful, knowing that finally what I've been anticipating for weeks, months is finally going to come and on May 8th, I'll have been relieved of
                        most of my stress. I want to keep this immersion entry thing I've got going. Weeks like this aren't good for building a habit.<br>

                        <br>Despite what I have in the table, I have done reading, listening, Anki, grammar review; I just haven't recorded it. Again, not a good week.<br>

                        <br>On the bright side, I've realized that reading キノの旅 isn't as such as pain as it used to be. I'm a lot more tolerant to reading than when I started. It feels 
                        good that I've at least got this. I can comprehend most things, but if its semi "deep" then 40% of my comprehension of the scene goes out the window. I can't wait
                        for all these exams to be over. After the SAT and AP cs exam, I've got multiple weeks to study for the AP bio one. This time I won't have to study for two at a time.<br>
                        
                        <br>Seriously, I'm gonna start prepping for AP stats and calculus AB as soon as summer starts, I'm not gonna deal with this nonsense again. Like, come on.<br>

                        <br> Oh well, at least I don't need to submit my SAT scores if I don't want to. I'm beginning to accept that what matters more is the AP cs exam. Now that my projects are done,
                        I can focus most of my time on taking practice exams, and tomorrow Mr. Marques will go over the frqs.<br>
                        
                        <br>Also, this counts as April since this week began in April, I will make a page for May.

                    <p width=95% text-align=left;>Comments: Busy week. Panicking about SAT and AP CS exam, I feel like I should've started prepping months ago. 
                        I need to reduce my listening time, but I rarely got the chance for the concentration for reading of any kind. 
                        Maybe when all these exams blow over</p>
