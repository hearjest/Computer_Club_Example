        <h4 text-align=left>Who are you?</h4>
        <p>My name is Brian. I like programming and Japanese. Programming is what I hope to be my career
        , but it'd be cool if Japanese got involved somehow.</p>
        <h4>Why programming and Japanese?</h4>
        <p>Well I like the sheer amount of possibilities programming can give me. It allows me to help myself and others, but I'm still 
          very much a beginner. I also wanted to know how dropdown menus worked. <br>
          As for Japanese, I'd watched a ton of anime while I was young and I thought "man, wouldn't it be cool to understand Japanese without reading
          subtitles?" and here I am. I've started studying Japanese March~ish of sophomore year of highschool.
        </p>
        <h4>What do you hope for in the future?</h4>
        <p>I'm happy enough getting decently paid at some web development or something programming oriented job. 
          I really just want to live financially stable while also getting the chance to invest into programming and Japanese more.
