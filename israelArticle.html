            <p>As exhausting as politics are, us civilians rarely get the chance to listen to the opinions from the other side that aren’t just from money and power hungry politicians whose goals are out of line with the common people.<br>
                <br>So in an effort to break the us-versus-them mentality (and to distract myself from my agonizing thirst), I’d like to give you Palestinians what a real Israelis opinion on Israel and Palestine’s various issues looks like.
                </p>

                <h4><b>Jerusalem</b></h4>

                <p>Jerusalem has been a major point of contention between Israel and Palestine for many decades, but why hasn’t either side given up their claim? It’s because of both sides’ faulty evidence; a game of he-said-she-said where neither claim can be proven right, but at the same time cannot be proven false. 
                    So if it’s military force that’s being used to determine “ownership” of Jerusalem, then it doesn’t matter who said what first, what matters is that both nations want to be able to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem and this is easily resolved through both nations having a share of Jerusalem. 
                    If both nations claim to have rights to it, let them both have it.<br> </p>

                <p>If we still cannot for certain decide who truly has the rights to Jerusalem after decades of bloodshed and misery, then will there ever be a day where solid evidence of any kind is presented? 
                    Would it not be easier then, to instead compromise and share the rights to Jerusalem, given its massive religious significance to both Israel and Palestine? 
                    We grow up realizing that the world is not as black and white as it seems, so it makes no sense that something as complicated as the true ownership of Jerusalem would be any different. 
                    Undoubtedly, if this compromise were to happen, the feud between our people will not clear instantly, but I’d rather have the chance to go than not at all. 
                </p>

                <p>Tensions prolonged by both the inability to compromise and share Jerusalem and Jerusalem’s increased visitation for prayer during Ramadan followed by bursts of violence are the kind of results we can continue to expect as long as Israel and Palestine remain stubborn about the validity of their claims. 
                    Rockets, missiles, fire bombs, clashes with police, Hamas involvement; the longer we wait, the longer both nations will equip and prepare themselves for combat with one another and the deeper hostility for one another seeps in. The lack of progress over the decades is embarrassing in addition to how each nation will make up with each other when the international community is directly glaring at them, only to find another reason to bicker and fight the next second. 
                    Rather than having grown up after all the wars and uprisings (and this is for Israel in particular) and using the Oslo Accords as the first step for further negotiations, all we have to show for it are issues yet to be resolved, and repeat outbreaks of violence. 
                </p>

                <h4><b>The First Intifada</h4>
                </p>

                <p>Even as tragic as the results of the First Intifidada were and the events that led up to it (such as further land encroachment and repression against activism), it was a necessary evil. While most victims of the Intifida did not deserve any harm of any kind they received (because of the peaceful protest methods used in contrast to the molotov cocktail throwing and such,) the sacrifices from both nations were necessary to set the stage for the potential of future peace talks and the beginning of what could be an independent Palestinian statehood through the Oslo Accords.
                </p>

                <p>Rarely does anything beneficial come from nothing, we understand this well, and if thousands of injuries and death are the price for the possibility of a better future, then so be it. This is the exact reason why the Palestinians began the uprising in the first place. If not for this uprising, it would’ve taken decades for something like the Oslo Accords to come into effect, or perhaps they’d have been no chance at all. With the signing of the Oslo Accords, it has proven that Israel and Palestine, contrary to popular belief, are indeed capable of peaceful discussion and it is imperative that both nations, particularly Palestine, capitalize on this opportunity. 
                </p>

                <h4><b>Peace</b></h4>

                <p>Even as a citizen of the opposing nation, I still just want peace between our nations. I’m tired of waking up everyday and knowing that someone on the other side considers me their enemy and suppressor and that my government is actively trying to make the lives of our neighbors as miserable as possible, going as far as to be accused of human rights violations and breaching international law. I’m tired of not being able to coexist peacefully with my neighbors. There must be peace and it can be found in the two state solution proposed in the Oslo Accords. (The amount of potential that these agreements have given are just that good.)
                </p>

                <p>The two-state solution is commonly seen as the best of the two options for peace between Israel and Palestine, and for good reason. It enables for Israel to maintain the power they already have while at the same time granting Palestine independent statehood, allowing for each country to run themselves as they please without being able to subject the other to their laws. It’s simple, easy to implement, but extremely effective. The one-state solution on the other hand, isn’t such a great idea.
                </p>

                <p>While having both nations live under the same name and seeing each other as regular citizens of the same nation seems like an enticing idea, it may do more harm than good. That mainly stems from the already deeply rooted hostility between the Israelis and Palestinians. They can hardly stand around the same gate as each other, (in Jerusalem no less), without causing a ruckus and fight, let alone having them next door to each other. Furthermore, the sheer size of the Palestinian population will likely cause unfair elections and the enactment of discriminatory laws. The amount of conflict would likely even worsen, not only because of the Palestinians finally (and admittedly rightfully) having the chance for retaliation, but also because all these new policies and laws will directly affect Israelis as well. Lastly, for the one state solution to happen at all would be impossible. Given events like the 1948 war and the Six Day War, in addition to having stayed in power and seen the extent to which they could bully the Palestinians, there is no doubt in my mind that Israel would ever give so much power only for the previous two points to occur. If we’re going to have a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, it’ll have to be under one where even Israel will agree; the two-state solution.
                </p>

                <p>So, now what? What is the next step? For you Palestinians, I don’t think much could be done other than to persist, peacefully protest and try to gather international support. However, there is something that could be done by everybody that would lead to greater change; be empathetic. So many of us are absorbed in our own lives and fail to see the significance of the bigger picture that it's no wonder that issues such as claims over Jerusalem have continued for so long. If only we could better understand each other would our problems be more quickly to be solved.
